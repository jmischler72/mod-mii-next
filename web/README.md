# Mod Mii Next

## What is this project?

ModMiiNext aims to be a modern version of the original ModMii project. Currently, it can analyze your Nintendo Wii console's system configuration and automatically provide the exact WAD files needed to update your system's homebrew components.

Simply upload your Wii's `syscheck.csv` file (generated by the [SysCheck homebrew app](https://wii.hacks.guide/syscheck.html)), and this tool will analyze your system's current state, identify missing or outdated components, and provide a convenient ZIP download containing all the necessary WAD files for your specific system configuration.

## Connection to ModMii

This project is inspired by and builds upon the incredible work of [ModMii by XFlak](https://modmii.github.io/), the Windows application that has been the go-to tool for Wii homebrew management.

#### What is ModMii?

ModMii is a Windows application that can softmod any Wii, WiiU, or vWii console. It downloads all necessary files, generates custom guides, updates outdated homebrew, and performs many other Wii hacking functions including USB-loader setup and emulated NAND creation.

While ModMii is an incredibly comprehensive desktop application, this web-based tool focuses specifically on the syscheck analysis and WAD file provision functionality, making it accessible from any device with a web browser.

## How it works

1. **Upload Syscheck**: Upload your `syscheck.csv` file generated by the SysCheck Updater homebrew app on your Wii.
2. **Analysis**: The server analyzes your console's configuration and identifies missing or outdated components.
3. **WAD "Caching"**: It downloads the necessary WAD files from ModMii sources and stores them in S3 for easy access.
4. **Download**: Get a customized ZIP file containing all the WAD files your system needs.
